# HL2_Metrocops_Kick_Grenades_Away

For the Metrocops, I decided to just give them the ability to kick grenades away.

I feel like picking up a grenade and trying to throw it back at the enemy is a risk that only a more professional warrior, like a Combine Soldier or Elite, would take and not guys who are basically just citizens in police uniforms.

Just like with the Combine Soldiers, the Metrocop’s kick will be in the direction he’s facing when he sees the grenade, making it unpredictable where it will end up.

And once again, I don’t claim the code or feel the need to be credited. You’re free to use it as is or as a blueprint for your own version. :)
